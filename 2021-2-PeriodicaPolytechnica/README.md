### TEAM35
Pavel Karban, David Pánek, Tamás Orosz, Ivo Doležel, 
[Semi-analytical Solution for a Multi-objective TEAM Benchmark Problem](https://pp.bme.hu/eecs/article/view/16093) 

This project shows a semi-analytical and a FEM-based solution of the TEAM Benchmark #35 test problem, where the shape
of a coil should be optimized. The goal of the optimization is to find a homogenous magnetic field distribution inside 
the coil, while its losses or the robustness of the solution should be maximized. 

### HV Cable Parameters
Mustafa, E., Németh, R. M., Afia, R. S. A., Tamus, Z. Ádám,
[Parameterization of Debye Model for Dielectrics Using Voltage Response Measurements and a Benchmark Problem ](https://pp.bme.hu/eecs/article/view/16399)

The proposed example shows a genetic algorithm based function fitting methodology to find the R-C parameters of the Debye-model
of a high voltage cable. The connecting paper contains the detailed description of the measurement and the benchmarking results.
